Hey you guys Mike aka Speed here, and thanks for downloading BlackScreen.

Now with BlackScreen being fullscreen, you're probably wondering, "Hey! How am I suppose to close this program???" Well it's very easy.

On Windows as well as Linux there's a special hotkey/shortcutkey that you press to close the active window, and it's...

				Alt+F4

If you're a Mac user it's...
				Command+Q!

Simply open up a web browser, image editor, folder, etc: and press that hotkey, and the window will close automatically.

(I found this hotkey out when I right clicked the running application in the taskbar (via Windows), and on Linux (Particularly Ubuntu) I did the same thing (except panel, not taskbar)

If you're wondering how I foundout about a Mac, run any program, say TextEdit you haft to click on TextEdit in the Finder, and then Quit TextEdit. On the right of that is the hotkey, and that's how I foundout about it.)

NOTE: You'll HAFT to use this hotkey to close BlackScreen.

Now I made BlackScreen in Java simply to prank one of my
friends, but have nothing bad happen to his computer. So if you'd
like to prank others using this program by all means feel free, but
I'm not responsible if you get the crap beat out of you :)

Also let me point out that because this is a Java application (aka Java jar)
it's cross platform so if you're running Windows, Linux, or even Mac OS X, or
any operating system that supports Java then you're in luck.

Have Fun, and Be Careful!!!

NOTE: On Windows, and Linux you can still use Alt+Tab to switch between running applications, but on a Mac you can't use Command+Tab it won't work. At least for me it didn't work...
