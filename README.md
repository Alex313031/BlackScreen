# BlackScreen
Simple, cross platform program to blank a screen (turn all pixels black to #000000)

This is a fork and continuation of this > https://sourceforge.net/projects/black-screen/

The site for it is a deviant art page here > https://www.deviantart.com/michaelsboost/art/BlackScreen-184509075

It was originally designed as a prank application, but I found it useful for watching movies with multiple monitors, to blank out the side ones, \
 and it could also be used for things like stuck pixel detection, or for cleaning the screen.
 
 NOTE: Sometimes it can be hard to close it, so I reccomend using task manager on Windows to close the process, or to use \`killall BlackScreen\`.
